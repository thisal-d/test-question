### **1. Constant Property (E(c) = c)**

1. A lottery ticket guarantees a fixed prize of \$50. What is the expected value of the prize?

---

### **2. Sum with Constant (E\[X + c] = E\[X] + c)**

2. A random variable X represents the number of heads in two coin flips. Find $E[X + 3]$.

---

### **3. Scaling (E\[c \* X] = c \* E\[X])**

3. Roll a fair 6-sided die once. Let X = number on the die. Find $E[2X]$.

---

### **4. Using Function (E\[g(X)] = Î£ g(x)P(X=x))**

4. Roll a fair 4-sided die. Let X = number on the die. Find $E[X^2]$.

---

### **5. Sum of Random Variables (E\[X + Y] = E\[X] + E\[Y])**

5. Roll two fair dice. Let X = first die, Y = second die. Find $E[X + Y]$.

---

### **6. Combination of Scaling and Sum**

6. A coin is tossed 3 times. Let X = number of heads, Y = number of tails. Find $E[2X + 3Y]$.

### **7. Dice Word Problem**

7. Roll a die. Win \$5 times the number rolled. What is the expected winning?

---

### **8. Multiple Random Variables**

8. Random variables X and Y are defined as follows: X = number of red balls, Y = number of blue balls drawn from a bag. Find $E[X + 2Y]$ if:

* X = 0 or 1, P(X=0)=0.3, P(X=1)=0.7
* Y = 0 or 1, P(Y=0)=0.5, P(Y=1)=0.5
