## Question 4: Game Character Class Selector

### Lab Test Question

Write a **console-based program** using **switch–case** to simulate a game character class selection system.

#### Requirements:

1. Available character classes:
   * **W** – Warrior – Health: 150, Attack: 20
   * **M** – Mage – Health: 80, Attack: 40
   * **A** – Archer – Health: 100, Attack: 30
   * **R** – Rogue – Health: 90, Attack: 35

2. The user can:
   * Enter a **character class (W/M/A/R)**.
   * Enter the **character name**.

3. Use a **switch–case** statement to display character stats.
   * **Important**: The system should be **case-sensitive** (only accept uppercase letters).
   * If the user enters an **invalid class**, show a message:
     ```
     Invalid character class! Please use uppercase letters only.
     ```

4. After each selection, the program must ask:
   ```
   Create another character? (Y/N):
   ```
   * Only accept **exactly 'Y' or 'N'** (uppercase, single character).
   * Any other input should be rejected with:
     ```
     Invalid input! Please enter Y or N only.
     ```

5. At the end, display:
   * The **total characters created**.
   * The **list of all character names** with their classes.
