## Question 2: Student Grade Calculator

### Lab Test Question

Write a **console-based program** using **switch–case** to calculate student grades based on marks.

#### Requirements:

1. Grade categories based on marks:
   * **A** – 90 to 100
   * **B** – 80 to 89
   * **C** – 70 to 79
   * **D** – 60 to 69
   * **F** – Below 60

2. The user can:
   * Enter **student marks** (0-100).
   * The program will determine the grade.

3. Use a **switch–case** statement to determine the grade.
   * **Important**: The system should be **case-sensitive** when displaying grade descriptions.
   * If marks are **out of range**, show a message:
     ```
     Invalid marks! Please enter between 0 and 100.
     ```

4. After each student, the program must ask:
   ```
   Do you want to calculate another grade? (yes/no):
   ```
   * If the user types **"YES"** (uppercase only), repeat the process.
   * If the user types **"NO"** (uppercase only), stop the loop.
   * Any other input should be rejected.

5. At the end, display:
   * The **total number of students processed**.
   * The **grade distribution** (count of each grade).
