## Question 8:  Bookstore

**Scenario:**
A bookstore has a quirky system where the product selection is flexible, but the final command to exit must be precise.

**Requirements:**
1.  The system offers the same 3 book types with the same prices and discounts.
2.  The book type entry must be **case-insensitive** (accept 'g', 'G', 'f', 'F', etc.).
3.  Ask for the number of books and calculate the total price, applying the discount if the quantity is 4 or more.
4.  Ask the user if they want to continue. This prompt must be **strictly case-sensitive**, accepting **only** uppercase 'Y' or 'N'. If a lowercase 'y' or 'n' is entered, it should be treated as an invalid command, and the program should ask again until a valid uppercase letter is received.

**Example Run:**
```
Enter Book Type (G, F, H): g
Enter the number of books: 4
Total Price: 3840.0
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? y
Invalid input. Please enter Y or N.
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? Y

Enter Book Type (G, F, H): h
Enter the number of books: 1
Total Price: 2500.0
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? N
```

### Question 4: Specific-Case Book Code System

**Scenario:**
A bookstore uses a non-standard set of codes where the case of the letter is part of the code itself. Your program must match these codes exactly.

**Requirements:**
1.  The book codes are case-sensitive and must be entered as follows:
    *   **'g' (lowercase)** - Gaming books, Price: 1200, Discount: 20%
    *   **'F' (uppercase)** - Fiction books, Price: 500, Discount: 10%
    *   **'H' (uppercase)** - History books, Price: 2500, Discount: 15%
2.  The program must be **case-sensitive** and accept **only** these specific cases ('g', 'F', 'H'). Any other variation (like 'G', 'f', or 'h') is invalid and should display "Invalid Type".
3.  Ask for the number of books and calculate the total price, applying the discount for quantities of 4 or more.
4.  The continuation prompt should be **case-insensitive** for user convenience (accept 'y', 'Y', 'n', 'N').

**Example Run:**
```
Enter Book Type (g, F, H): G
Invalid Type
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? y

Enter Book Type (g, F, H): g
Enter the number of books: 2
Total Price: 2400.0
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? Y

Enter Book Type (g, F, H): f
Invalid Type
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? n
