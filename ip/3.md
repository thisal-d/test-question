## Question 3: Transportation Mode Selector

### Lab Test Question

Write a **console-based program** using **switch–case** to help users select transportation modes and calculate travel costs.

#### Requirements:

1. Available transportation modes:
   * **b** – Bus – 50 per km
   * **t** – Taxi – 100 per km
   * **r** – Train – 30 per km
   * **a** – Auto – 70 per km

2. The user can:
   * Enter a **transportation mode (b/t/r/a)**.
   * Enter the **distance in kilometers**.

3. Use a **switch–case** statement to calculate the cost.
   * **Important**: The system should be **case-insensitive** (accept both uppercase and lowercase).
   * If the user enters an **invalid mode**, show a message:
     ```
     Invalid transportation mode! Please try again.
     ```

4. After each calculation, the program must ask:
   ```
   Do you want to calculate another trip? (Yes/No):
   ```
   * Accept any case variation of "yes" or "no" (Yes, YES, yes, No, NO, no).

5. At the end, display:
   * The **total distance traveled**.
   * The **total cost**.
   * The **most used transportation mode**.

#### Example Run

```
Transportation Mode Selector
b - Bus - 50 per km
t - Taxi - 100 per km
r - Train - 30 per km
a - Auto - 70 per km

Enter transportation mode (b/t/r/a): T
Enter distance in km: 10
Cost: 1000
Do you want to calculate another trip? (Yes/No): yes

Enter transportation mode (b/t/r/a): r
Enter distance in km: 20
Cost: 600
Do you want to calculate another trip? (Yes/No): YES

Enter transportation mode (b/t/r/a): x
Invalid transportation mode! Please try again.

Enter transportation mode (b/t/r/a): B
Enter distance in km: 5
Cost: 250
Do you want to calculate another trip? (Yes/No): no

Total distance traveled: 35 km
Total cost: 1850
Most used mode: Taxi
