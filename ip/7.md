## Question 7: Book Order System

**Scenario:**
A high-security bookstore requires a strictly formatted ordering system. Any deviation from the specified capitalization will be rejected.

**Requirements:**
1.  The system offers the same 3 book types:
    *   **G** - Gaming books, Price: 1200, Discount: 20%
    *   **F** - Fiction books, Price: 500, Discount: 10%
    *   **H** - History books, Price: 2500, Discount: 15%
2.  The system must be **strictly case-sensitive**. It should **only** accept uppercase letters ('G', 'F', 'H'). Any lowercase input ('g', 'f', 'h') must be considered invalid and trigger the "Invalid Type" message.
3.  Ask for the number of books and calculate the total price with a discount for quantities of 4 or more.
4.  Ask the user if they want to continue. The continuation prompt ('Y/N') must also be **strictly case-sensitive**, accepting **only** uppercase 'Y' or 'N'. Any other input should be ignored, and the program should continue asking until a valid 'Y' or 'N' is entered.

**Example Run:**
```
Enter Book Type (G, F, H): g
Invalid Type
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? y
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? Y

Enter Book Type (G, F, H): F
Enter the number of books: 3
Total Price: 1500.0
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? N
```
