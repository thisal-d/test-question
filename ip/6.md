## Question 6: Book Purchase System

**Scenario:**
You are tasked with creating a program for a bookstore that allows customers to order books. The system should be user-friendly and not strict about capitalization.

**Requirements:**
1.  There are 3 types of books available:
    *   **G** - Gaming books, Price: 1200, Discount: 20%
    *   **F** - Fiction books, Price: 500, Discount: 10%
    *   **H** - History books, Price: 2500, Discount: 15%
2.  The system must accept **both uppercase and lowercase** letters for the book type (e.g., 'g' and 'G' should work).
3.  Ask the user for the number of books. A discount is applied only if the quantity is 4 or more.
4.  Calculate and display the total price after any applicable discount.
5.  Ask the user if they want to continue. The continuation prompt should also be **case-insensitive** (accept 'y', 'Y', 'n', 'N').
6.  If an invalid book type is entered, display "Invalid Type" and allow the user to try again without ending the program.

**Example Run:**
```
Enter Book Type (G, F, H): f
Enter the number of books: 5
Total Price: 2250.0
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? y

Enter Book Type (G, F, H): H
Enter the number of books: 2
Total Price: 5000.0
Do you want to continue (Y/N)? n
```
