A machine that fills soft drink bottles is supposed to dispense 500 ml per bottle. A random sample of 36 bottles has a mean fill of 497 ml and a standard deviation of 8 ml.
At the 5% significance level, test whether the machine is underfilling the bottles.
(Assume the population is approximately normal.)

### **3.**

A tire manufacturer claims that its tires last an average of 40,000 km. A consumer group believes that the average life is actually less.
A sample of 25 tires showed a mean lifetime of 38,900 km with a standard deviation of 1,500 km.
At the 1% significance level, test whether the consumer group’s belief is supported.

### **4.**

A new teaching method is tested to determine whether it improves student performance.
A random sample of 16 students taught using the new method has an average score of 78, with a sample standard deviation of 6.
The average score using the traditional method is known to be 75.
Test at the 5% significance level whether the new teaching method improves performance.

The following data represent the number of hours per week that 10 employees spend on online meetings:
12, 10, 11, 13, 9, 14, 12, 15, 10, 11

i. Calculate the **mean** and **standard deviation**.
ii. Test whether the average meeting time per week is **less than 12 hours**, using a **0.05 significance level**.
(Assume the data are from a normal population.)
