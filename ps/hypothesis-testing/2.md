1. A soft drink company claims that its 500 ml bottles have an average fill of 500 ml. A sample of 50 bottles shows a mean fill of 498 ml with a population standard deviation of 5 ml. Test at the 1% significance level whether the mean fill is different from 500 ml.

2. A factory produces light bulbs with a claimed average lifetime of 1,200 hours. A random sample of 10 bulbs gives a mean lifetime of 1,150 hours with a sample standard deviation of 60 hours. Test at the 5% significance level whether the bulbs are lasting less than claimed.

3. A school claims that its students score on average 70 in a math test. A random sample of 12 students taught with a new method scored an average of 74 with a sample standard deviation of 5. Test at the 5% significance level whether the new method increases scores.

4. The average weight of packaged rice is claimed to be 10 kg. A sample of 64 packages shows a mean weight of 10.2 kg with a population standard deviation of 0.5 kg. Test at the 5% significance level whether the mean weight differs from 10 kg.

5. A bank claims that the average waiting time for service is at most 10 minutes. A sample of 36 customers shows an average waiting time of 12 minutes with a population standard deviation of 4 minutes. Test at the 1% significance level whether the waiting time exceeds 10 minutes.

6. A mobile phone manufacturer claims that the average battery life is 20 hours. A sample of 16 phones shows an average life of 18.5 hours with a sample standard deviation of 2 hours. Test at the 5% significance level whether the average battery life is less than claimed.

7. A delivery company claims that the average delivery time is 48 hours. A sample of 40 deliveries shows an average time of 50 hours with a population standard deviation of 4 hours. Test at the 5% significance level whether the delivery time differs from the claim.

8. A fitness trainer claims that his new training program increases push-up performance. A sample of 15 trainees has an average increase of 8 push-ups with a sample standard deviation of 3. The standard push-up count is 5. Test at the 1% significance level whether the program improves performance.

9. A soft drink bottling machine is supposed to dispense 1.5 liters per bottle. A sample of 25 bottles shows an average of 1.48 liters with a sample standard deviation of 0.04 liters. Test at the 5% significance level whether the machine underfills the bottles.

10. A computer manufacturer claims that the average lifespan of its laptops is 5 years. A sample of 36 laptops shows an average lifespan of 4.8 years with a population standard deviation of 0.3 years. Test at the 5% significance level whether the average lifespan is different from the claim.
