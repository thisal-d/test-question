### **Property 1: $V(c) = 0$**

1. A game gives a **fixed prize of \$10**. What is the variance of the prize?

---

### **Property 2: $V[g(X) + c] = V[g(X)]$**

2. Roll a fair 6-sided die. Let X = number on the die. Find $V[X + 5]$.

---

### **Property 3: $V[c \cdot g(X)] = c^2 \cdot V[g(X)]$**

3. Roll a fair 4-sided die. Let X = number on the die. Find $V[3X]$.

---

### **Property 4: $V[X + Y] = V[X] + V[Y] + 2Cov(X,Y)$**

4. Random variables X and Y represent the outcomes of **two dependent dice** where Cov(X, Y) = 1. X and Y each have variance 2. Find $V[X + Y]$.

5. Roll two independent fair 6-sided dice. Find $V[X + Y]$.

---

### **Property 5: $V[X - Y] = V[X] + V[Y] - 2Cov(X,Y)$**

6. Random variables X and Y represent scores of two dependent players. Var(X) = 4, Var(Y) = 9, Cov(X,Y) = 2. Find Var(X−Y).

7. Roll **two independent dice**. Find Var(X−Y).

---

### **Property 6: Independence → Cov(X,Y)=0**

8. Let X = number of heads in 3 coin flips, Y = number of tails in 3 coin flips (assume X and Y independent). Find $V[X + Y]$.

9. Roll two independent dice. Let X = first die, Y = second die. Find $V[2X + 3Y]$.

### **Combination Question**

10. Roll a fair 6-sided die. Let X = number on the die. Let W = 4X + 7. Find Var(W).
